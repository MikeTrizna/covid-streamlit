This app is designed to be used by SI staff to calculate their COVID risk level when working on-site.

The user can choose to input different parameters depending on a scenario.

***If you do not know exact values for some of these parameters feel free to estimate or to use a preset scenario that most closely matches what you are looking for.***

The different parameters that can be adjusted are:

1.	the dimensions of space of interest

2.	the number of air changes per hour, MERV filtration value, and recirculation rate, *(use presets if not known)*

3.	the breathing and quanta exhalation rate of infected people *(use presets if not known)*

4.	the exhalation mask efficiency of the user, the percentage of people in the same space wearing masks, and the inhalation mask efficiency,

5.	the duration of the work, and the number of repetitions, and

6.	the total number of people in the space and the number of those that are infected.

After adjusting parameters to a specific work situation, users receive a probability of infection value as a percentage. The model is an aerosol transmission risk estimator- which means if people in the room are not physically distancing or using face coverings there is ADDITIONAL risk due to droplet transmission.
