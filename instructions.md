This app is designed to be used by SI staff to calculate their COVID risk level when working on-site. 
The user can choose to input different parameters depending on: 

1. the dimensions of space they will be working in,
2. the number of air changes per hour, MERV filtration value, and recirculation rate,
3. the breathing and quanta exhalation rate of infected people,
4. the exhalation mask efficiency of the user, the percentage of people in the same space wearing masks, and the inhalation mask efficiency,
5. the duration of the work, and the number of repetitions, and
6. the total number of people in the space and the number of those that are infected.

After adjusting parameters to a specific work situation, users receive a probability of infection value as a percentage. Users can calculate probabilities for multiple scenarios and download an Excel file containing the results. App users may not know exact values for some of these parameters depending on their scenario of interest. In order to demonstrate some potential scenarios of interest, here are three different calculations for large, medium, and small Smithsonian spaces.
